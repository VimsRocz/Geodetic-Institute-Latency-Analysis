# Geodetic-Institute-Latency-Analysis
This project investigates the latency between angle and distance measurements using automatic total stations, focusing on Leica TS30 and Leica Nova MS50 models. Students utilize the GeoCOM command set for total station control and data acquisition, building upon their previous work in lab exercises.
