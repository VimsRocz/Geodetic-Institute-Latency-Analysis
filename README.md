##  Investigation of Latency in Total Station Measurements

---

### Introduction:
This lab delves into the exploration of latency between angle and distance measurements using automatic total stations, particularly focusing on Leica TS30 and Leica Nova MS50 models. Students are required to employ the GeoCOM command set for total station control and data acquisition, utilizing their previously prepared program code from lab work 1.

### Procedure:
1. **Measurement Setup:** Conduct measurements within the Geodetic Institute's cellar using the assigned total station along with various prism types.
2. **Measurement Modes:** Implement Tracking and Synchro-Tracking distance measurement modes as appropriate for the Leica TS30 or Leica Nova MS50.
3. **Latency Calculation:** Utilize equations discussed in lectures to calculate the latency time (Œîùë°Œ±,S) between angle and distance measurements.

### Discussion Points:

1. **Total Station Connection and GeoCOM Command Set:** Provide insights into the overall structure of the total station connection and the ASCII request/response structure of the GeoCOM command set, supported by an illustrative example.

2. **Developed Commands:** Briefly explain the commands developed for total station control, outlining their functionality and relevance.

3. **Determination Method of Latency Time:** Discuss the methodology employed for determining latency time, velocity, updated coordinates, and their standard deviations in both forward and backward directions. Include details regarding the test setup and methodology used.

4. **Results Discussion:** Analyze the obtained results for latency, comparing them within the group and highlighting any observed variations. Provide insights into potential factors contributing to these differences.
